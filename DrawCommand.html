                      <h4>Exercise 2: DrawCommand</h4>
                      <p><i>DrawCommand</i> is a series of sketches created in December 2018 using an instruction generator of the same name. The sketches were undertaken to explore the idea of a computer taking the conceptual generation of each system out of my direct control. The exercise also explores my reaction to being less in control of the generation of a system and the art. This exercise was carried out with the idea of developing future work in which a computer learns what I prefer to do or gathers information for possible gestures or graphic components of art from an image database. This section sets out some of my thoughts about this exercise.

                      <p><i>DrawCommand</i> randomly selects from the elements I used in my fine art systems; duration, intervals of time, material, and action, to create simple instructions which I then carry out to make a piece of art.
                        The process turns me into a biological machine that carries out the system, and, in this respect, it is a direct development of my fine art systems. It also presents a new development in the use of systems in my practice; my brain has been supplanted by the computer which is imitating my cognitive process to generate systems through the use of random. This approach also reduces the possibility that I can intuitively alter the system, at least before I start work. In Systems art the beginning and end of the system are usually the points where the artist has the most influence; the computer instructing the artist when and how to begin and end presents an approach in which the computer and artist have been inverted.
                      </p>

                      <p>In terms of my reaction to this setup, I thought I would dislike the process beforehand due to my loss of control over the system and art-making process. I found, however, that I was very comfortable working this way; in fact, I found it quite freeing. I found that I misinterpreted rules or missed intervals more than I might have if I had come up with the specific system myself. I also found that because I had less time to think or react to the instructions, I was quite spontaneous when I was working. By transferring the generation of the system over to the computer, I found that my intuition was concentrated at any point of contact with the paper, rather than at the beginning and the end of specific systems, because I interpreted instructions. It emphasised that every time an artist interacts with the system represents a point at which possibilities enter the work. That is art. A computer cannot make art without possibilities.

                      <p><i>DrawCommand</i>, along with <i>Imitation of Life</i>, also presents another experiment looking into the possible surfaces on which my physical hand meets the non-physical computer hand. I was much more comfortable working with <i>DrawCommand</i> than <i>Imitation of Life</i> because I was working in the tangible, physical world as opposed to trying to interact with soft, indirect light from a projector. Furthermore, the world compared to a computer screen is dark and dull, light does not emit from white paper or yellow paint the way it could appear in all its flat glory on a computer screen. This exercise reinforced my conclusion from the printed drawing exercises in <i>Imitation of Life</i>, it is essential that I am comfortable working with the materials I work with, and I do not react well to light, the feeling of indirectness, flatness and a lack of texture.
                      </p>
                      <p><i>DrawCommand</i> also emphasised the importance of random in relation to the artist. Random creates the imitation of choices having been made regarding individual systems, which supplants my role as the artist, and provides a physical momentum to the art. Currently, it is acting as a less sophisticated stand-in for potential machine learning algorithms; however, in favour of random, I do like the idea of random as a unique, computer form of fake-life. In the next section, I will look further at the use of random to create complexity in my <i>DrawBots</i>.</p>
