                      <p>Exercise 2, <i>Draw Command</i>, presents a series of sketches in which I drew using an instruction generator. The sketches were undertaken to explore the idea of a computer taking the generation of each system out of my direct control and telling me what to do. It presents an exploration of my reaction to being less in control of the generation of a system, and the art, as much as the possible techniques I might need to develop to achieve a more sophisticated setup. This exercise was carried out with the idea of developing future work in which a computer learns what I prefer to do or gathers information for possible gestures or graphic components of art from an image database. This section sets out some of my thoughts about this exercise.

                      <p><i>DrawCommand</i> randomly selects from the elements I used in my fine art systems, such as, duration, intervals of time, material, and action to create simple instructions to make a piece of art. I then carried out these instructions. In this way the exercise is a direct extension of my systems work in art school. The process turns me into a machine and reduces the possibility that I can intuitively alter the system itself before I start work. I am also drawn to the idea of the role of the computer and artist being inverted in this exercise. From a systems art viewpoint where the beginning and end of the system are usually the points where the artist has the most influence in a more traditional practice, the idea of the system starting with the computer selecting the system and possibly telling the artist when to stop is quite engaging. In this way, it is a development in my systems practice from art school in that I become more of a physical than creative presence in the making of my art, at least at these key conceptual points.
                        </p>
                      <p>In terms of my reaction to this setup, I thought I would dislike it beforehand. However, I was very comfortable working this way. I found that I misinterpreted rules or missed intervals more than I might have if I had come up with the specific system myself and that, because I had less time to think or react to the instructions, that I was quite spontaneous when I was working. It emphasises my conclusions reached through my fine art systems work; every time an artist touches the paper represents a point at which possibilities enter the work. That is art. A computer cannot make art without possibilities.

                      <p><i>DrawCommand</i>, along with <i>Imitation of Life</i>, also presents another experiment looking into the possible surfaces on which my physical hand meets the non-physical computer hand. All these exercises are testing my reactions and exploring myself in these situations as much as any technical requirements. I was much more comfortable working with <i>DrawCommand</i> than <i>Imitation of Life</i> because I was working in the tangible, physical world as opposed to trying to interact with soft light from a projector. There is something too indirect about it. Furthermore, the world compared to a computer screen is dark and dull, light does not emit from white paper or yellow paint the way it could appear in all its flat glory on a computer screen. This exercise emphasised to me the obvious; it is essential that I am comfortable working with the materials I work with, and I do not react well to light and flatness and a lack of texture.
                      </p>
                      <p><i>DrawCommand</i> also emphasised to me that random supplants the artist. It creates the imitation of a choice having been made in the system and provides a momentum to the art whilst also supplanting my choice as the artist. Currently, it is also a stand-in for potential machine learning algorithms, however, in favour of random, I do like the idea of random as a computer form of fake-life in itself. In the next section, I will look further at the use of random to create complexity in my <i>DrawBots</i>.</p>
