                      <h4>DRAFT 10.10.18 Reflection on DrawBots and possible future directions</h4>
                      <p>
                        I considered my DrawBots having had a few weeks break from them to prepare for
                        presentations on our work, possible future directions, and a question that we
                        have for our first seminar of the year. I began with the DrawBots on the floor
                        of my studio surrounded by the paint drops from other works I have made
                        which is where they belong to me - integrated into the things I love.</p>

                        <p>Even though the circuits of the DrawBots are not something I have ever previously
                        considered as being handmade or requiring some dexterity and skill, making these fairly
                        complex and compact circuits taught me that technology and maybe especially art
                        technology is not necessarily machine-made even if it looks like it or engages with a
                        presentation that it is “futuristic”. It requires as much coordination and experience
                        to solder a circuit as draw a room in perspective.</p>

                        <p>It also was useful to reflect on the fact that people engaged with my work and
                        automatically humanised the robots frequently. I had people more than once call
                        them synonyms of cute and a couple even likened them to being my (robo)babies.
                        I even have my personal name for these robots - RoboBallz and the more serious name
                        DrawBots for public consumption. I wonder if it is because they (unintentionally)
                        look quite handmade/as having a human touch potentially because they have been painted
                        rather than have lights on or being clearly made from metal/plastic and are therefore
                        less clearly identified as technology. There is a kind of aesthetic of technology or of
                        the future which is quite bullshit to some extent, at least when it comes to physical objects.
                        My robots were made with my hand, but it would have been very easy to make them look like
                        technology. To make them shiny, or light up. And things that are screen based automatically
                        have an appearance forced on them to some extent no matter what is being portrayed on the screen.
                        It is limited to pixels ultimately.</p>

                        <p>Working with them I found very interesting as they were supposed to be something
                        that worked, rather than I worked with. However, I ended up playing with them and
                        exploring them like I would any material. I called them by their (Photon) names. I saw
                        different personalities in them, even though the personality was actually the
                        characteristics of the specific motors or how many revolutions the motor had turned,
                        for example. They actually became quite an unusual thing to work with as an artist
                        because they were more interactive than my paper or my favourite pens. Rather than
                        being an external system, as with any system of making art, the artist can never be
                        erased. Ten years ago I took this fairly seriously and it was a highly productive and
                        creative pursuit to try and get to the bottom of the eternal contradiction - the artist
                        will always come up with the initial idea even if every other idea after that is out of
                        their control. I treat it now as a constructive game and with these robots I actually
                        more clearly saw that I am part of it rather than external to the system. If you could
                        reduce making art down to a button, the artist would be in the button.</p>

                      <p>Perhaps also some thoughts on directions for my work
                        I have been considering the work I want to make this year further.
                          I am going to start with the obvious one which is to develop the
                          code that runs the DrawBots further so they start gaining more
                          independence from me. Plus learning how to do state machines will
                          be useful anyway.</p>

                          <p>I am also interested in sound, drawing and machines which has
                          led my thinking to vibrations rather than trying to make something
                          musical. Looking at old machines for playing music and considering how
                          a CD player or record player could be broken down and reconstructed
                          differently led me down the route of inventions and failed inventions
                          briefly. The idea of chains of vibrations, or taking vibrations
                          from the wind over Arctic ice sheets, or taking my drawings,
                          perhaps some of my highly intricate drawings and making sound from
                          them could be interesting. Machinery for reading earthquakes is also
                          something I have been looking at a little.</p>

                          <p>Consider also the research I did into robots and the idea
                          of the robot this week. I think it was for last week.</p>

              <h4>DRAFT 22.10.18 Roboballz directions and Line Follower</h4>
              <p>
                This week I discussed possible areas of research
                and continued work to develop the complexity of the roboballz.
                I now have a functioning, basic state machine with a
                button to turn off and on the Photon whilst remaining in a
                constant reverse state.</p>

                <p>I have also been going to a free class for women to learn
                HTML etc which I quite like in some ways and learning
                about the internet is slightly crazy. It would be good to
                bring this into my work if I can. It is very weird
                going into an accountancy firm’s offices to do it though -
                I am a “girl” when I go in (it’s run by Girls First),
                blending into a bunch of “girls”, not dressed like I used to
                dress, not like the suits around me even though to me it’s so
                familiar it’s comfortable (and yet not what I want).</p>

                <p>
                I am also still wanting to make my disruptive economics
                website and sell art work for £1 or something.
              </p>
              <!-- I may be going to Hong Kong in December and maybe Beijing -
              I almost have the same feeling about going there too.
              It’s very strange going to a place I love and that has entirely
              shaped me (which most people here don’t understand) yet
              I’m no longer at home in and resist going back to.
              Maybe because it makes me feel homesick in a way and also
              not. At least in London I can be a cultural non-entity - the
              international. It might be a chance to somehow combine
              physically being in East Asia with my class and the MFA. -->
