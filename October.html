                      <h4>DRAFT 10.10.18 Reflection on DrawBots and possible future directions</h4>
                      <p>
                        I started the year by looking at the DrawBots on the floor of my studio where I had
                        left them a few weeks before, surrounded by paint drops from other works I have made.
                        I work a lot on my studio floor and the DrawBots belong there, in use and
                        integrated into the things I love. Looking at them there also started me thinking
                        about the aesthetics of technology or the aesthetics of the future, if that is the
                        same thing. Paint drops are not a thing normally associated with circuits and a robot.
                        Paint drops are fundamentally human, physical, potentially intended but not controlled.
                        Technology is contained, controlled, and has an intended purpose. Technology would
                        not usually be compatible with a paint-speckled studio floor.</p>

                        <p>The aesthetics of technology lacks any evidence of the human hand, and, by extension,
                          human presence. The materials are plastic or metal, and the edges and shapes regular,
                          maybe there are lights, maybe there are pixels. My DrawBots in contrast were covered in
                          paint and my fingerprints likely imprinted in the paint. In reality, this is more
                          representative of how items of technology, including some (or many?) <a href="https://www.itproportal.com/2012/02/23/apple-iphone-almost-entirely-handmade-abc-report-reveals/ ">commercial ones</a>,
                          have actually been made.
                          Having not made a circuit or soldered since I was 14, I had not been aware of how
                          handmade technology can be until I made the DrawBots. Making the fairly complicated and
                          compact circuits for the DrawBots required dexterity and skill. The DrawBots are as handmade
                          as a painting or traditional craft in some ways - they required physical endurance like making
                          some of my drawings can require, unlike a drawing they even caused me some pain from a shock
                          and soldering while making them. They are hybrids in some ways - my hands and effort mixed
                          with 3D printing and circuits. Though is that really different from a paintbrush in my hand
                          and acrylic paint? The presentation or perception is that technology (the future?) has no human
                          hand, apparently, however, the opposite is true. The aesthetics and potentially the general
                          perception of technology is kind of bullshit.</p>

                        <p>I have also been reflecting on the time the DrawBots were on show. The frequency with
                          which people humanised the robots was quite interesting. Numerous times the DrawBots
                          were called adorable or cute. While making with them and working with them, I naturally
                          began to humanise them myself. My DrawBots had names: Bob was my favourite because he was
                          reliable and just kept going, Fredricka was a bit temperamental. While they were running,
                          I worried about them and frequently kept an eye on them even when they did not need it. Is
                          there an equivalent word for anthropomorphic for robots/technology? Or for attachment to
                          an electronic object? </p>

                      <h5>Ideas</h5>
                      <p>1. On the one hand it would be good to develop the DrawBots either away
                        from being on a wire (on the floor, or vacuumed on to the wall, for example)
                        or develop the fact that they are wire-bound either in terms of creating a
                        grid or spider-web formation and perhaps more complex drawing appendages.
                        Alternatively, I could develop some weird drawing machine version of a
                        <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/One-man_band_street_performer_-_5.jpg/215px-One-man_band_street_performer_-_5.jpg">one-man band</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>2. I could explore the idea of balancing further through <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/gyroscopes-what-they-are-how-they-work-and-why-they-are-important">gyroscopes</a>
                          and combine kinetics with electronics.
                          </p>
                        <p>3. It could be interesting to look through weird patents or research
                          <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/9-interesting-failed-inventions-past">failed inventions</a>
                          and perhaps go off in a <a href="https://weburbanist.com/2012/04/25/fantastic-failures-10-wacky-extinct-products-from-the-past/ ">different direction</a>.
                          </p>
                        <p>4. Related to this is make a drawing machine based on older technology such as a
                          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimeograph">mimeograph</a>.</p>
                        <p>5. Again, somewhat related, explore sound and vibrations such as the eerie vibrations
                          from <a href="https://youtu.be/w56RxaX9THY">icebergs</a> and/or
                          perhaps make a drawing/vibration machine by adapting older technology such as
                          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph_cylinder">cylinder phonographs</a>
                          or even a CD player or tape player. Or build/adapt some kind of
                          seismometer and record/draw vibrations such as in the city.
                        </p>
                        <p>6. I continue to like the idea of a group of rolling balls that follows people
                          around in a gallery space, mildly harassing them/amusing them. The physics
                          of making a ball roll from a static position could be quite interesting
                          especially if the shapes are slightly irregular (almost like rolling stones ... pun intended),
                          powering them would probably use my experience from the DrawBots, and how they follow or
                          interact with people would be a new area for me. Some examples <a href="https://www.sphero.com ">here</a>
                          and <a href="https://www.libertytrading.co.uk/products/jumping-joggle-bopper-bumble-ball?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0IzZq9WN3gIVRjbTCh1sfwHKEAQYASABEgK4EPD_BwE&utm_campaign=gs-2018-10-12&utm_medium=smart_campaign&utm_source=google">here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>7. Last but not least, do what has been circulating in my mind in some
                          form for ten years and create a parallel artist to myself and interact with it.</p>

                      <p>Perhaps also some thoughts on directions for my work
                        I have been considering the work I want to make this year further.
                          I am going to start with the obvious one which is to develop the
                          code that runs the DrawBots further so they start gaining more
                          independence from me. Plus learning how to do state machines will
                          be useful anyway.</p>

                          <p>I am also interested in sound, drawing and machines which has
                          led my thinking to vibrations rather than trying to make something
                          musical. Looking at old machines for playing music and considering how
                          a CD player or record player could be broken down and reconstructed
                          differently led me down the route of inventions and failed inventions
                          briefly. The idea of chains of vibrations, or taking vibrations
                          from the wind over Arctic ice sheets, or taking my drawings,
                          perhaps some of my highly intricate drawings and making sound from
                          them could be interesting. Machinery for reading earthquakes is also
                          something I have been looking at a little.</p>

                          <p>Consider also the research I did into robots and the idea
                          of the robot this week. I think it was for last week.Generally, I find
                          this behaviour quite interesting in wider culture - not only are robots

              <h4>DRAFT 22.10.18 Systems art - reflecting on my (old) fine art practice</h4>
              <p>
                I have been continuing to reflect on my fine art practice in light of the
                DrawBots and the new skills and technology I have learned in the past year.
                My fine art practice has almost haunted me since I did my MA Fine Art. I
                was unable (even if I had been willing) to let go of my art practice. However,
                I had become bored by fine art materials which also struck me as failing to explore
                the materials of the times. I was also really put off by the narrowness and
                restrictions of the business of art which traded the names of artists like shares
                in a company whilst touting the novelty of the creativity and the bullshit of “emerging”
                artists. It reminded me of one of the reasons I became an accountant: independence and freedom.</p>
<p>In an artist statement from several years ago I said that <q>restrictions direct my action and reduce the influence of intuition to initial decisions. Each work is an experiment bound by a system that results in the unexpected</q>. An initial idea with the DrawBots was that they could materially represent elements of my fine art practice, for example, one could set time, one could be a certain material, another one might determine a certain movement and so these various components would come together to make system art as I used to make art. I wanted to explore the limitation of artistic intuition, and, therefore, the displacement of the artist, through computation. I had increasingly come to regard systems art as a game that could not be won. The reality of the DrawBots was that they emphasised the impossibility of game I have been playing. In my fine art practice, I tried to reduce myself to physical involvement as much as possible and I ended up refining (or highlighting) my involvement in what I called accidents. The blobs, the smears, the pen smudges. The life. The creativity. The not a robot. </p>
<p>With the DrawBots, I did not want to leave them alone, I played with them. I explored them. I put paint on them. I tried ink. I experimented. This resulted in two things: it made me interested in what it would take for them to become more of an equal than a tool; and it highlighted what I already knew: systems art resulting in the eradication of the artist such as I had been pursuing several years ago was not possible but there was much more to explore around the presence and absence of the artist through systems and by bringing computational and artist systems together. Rather than the artist (or human) being eradicated by some system (computational or otherwise), it could be explored, developed, brought together with computation and technology. </p>

              I almost have the same feeling about going there too.
              It’s very strange going to a place I love and that has entirely
              shaped me (which most people here don’t understand) yet
              I’m no longer at home in and resist going back to.
              Maybe because it makes me feel homesick in a way and also
              not. At least in London I can be a cultural non-entity - the
              international. It might be a chance to somehow combine
              physically being in East Asia with my class and the MFA. -->

                        <p>I have been working on switch statements to create a pretend-intelligence
                          for the DrawBots to develop them from being in the area of mechanical tools
                          to progressing them towards being more my parallel. My intention is to see
                          whether they feel more like my equal or remain tools when I actually work
                          with slightly more complicated behaviour. I am also exploring technically
                          how to imitate intelligence (or something that seems like intelligence).
                          Presumably creating complexity imitates intelligence.</p>

                        <p>In conjunction with this I am also exploring line following robots. This
                          is with the idea of taking the group communication and behaviour from the
                          DrawBots and merging this with line following robots to create a group of
                          line drawing and following robots that move along the floor that I interact
                          with and draw with too. This could be translated to

                          vertically on the wall. This is an alternative development of merging and
                          developing the concepts of systems art so the idea (or system) is not just
                          <q>the machine that makes the art</q> (Sol LeWitt). </p>
