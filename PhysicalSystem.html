                        <h4>The first iteration of DrawBots</h4>
                        <p>The first iteration of the DrawBots developed as physical representations of the components of my fine art system that I developed based on my drawing practice. The elements of a system could be duration, gesture, position, intervals, or materials. At one point, I saw them as one being the time element and commanding intervals to the other DrawBots, one being a pencil, one being paint, perhaps one with a gesture etc. I saw them as another possibility to continue the constructive game of reducing the influence of the artist in the making of the work. </p>
                        <p>In actuality, unless they were drawing with a pencil, it was necessary for me to be around the DrawBots while they drew to refill the pen with ink or to put paint on the paper to be smeared. They required tending to if they were actively making art, though they were physically self-sufficient for a day at a time otherwise. Working with them solidified the conclusion I had already reluctantly come to that to try to eradicate the artist through the use of a system to create was a game and winning was not possible. </p>
                        <p>I had always involved my physical presence in my work, which is unusual in the context of the systems art I was producing, and with the DrawBots I found I was again present even when I thought I had eradicated this by using battery-operated robots to draw. Rather than the DrawBots drawing on their own, I was playing with them. I was learning while they were not. I was proceeding from pencil, to ink, to paint and exploring them. I was enjoying myself. The DrawBots were a tool or a toy (LINK TO BLOG).</p>

                        <h4>Complexity</h4>
                        <p>My first step in exploring my reaction to the DrawBots and exploring the interaction
                          between the artist and the system in the context of computation was to create further complexity.
                          Switch statements have therefore been included to take the behaviour further from my prediction.
                          And therefore give the impression of independence. This was also a useful technical tool to use if
                          I develop alternative physical swarms of bots. Sine waves alter the speed on command from one DrawBot. </p>

                          <p>I can see that randomness is key to the impression of life from my work. I naturally want to include
                            random in the code (and will) so that the prediction gets harder for me to make as to the behaviour of the
                            DrawBots. The tie to my fine art practice, where randomness/mistakes were where I decided creativity was
                            and which were exposed through the system is quite intriguing. I went around and around that, the system I made
                            ten years ago kept leading me back to myself. I could obscure myself to try to eradicate the artist, but I
                            emphasised only that it was impossible. The most I could reduce myself to was a decision in theory but the closest
                            I could get to erasing the artist was to theoretically obscure the artist in rules. Is this AI? If so it
                            definitely deserves the name artificial. Is random natural behaviour (or the imitation of it at least)?</p>
