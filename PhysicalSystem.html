							<h4>DrawBots</h4>
							<p>The DrawBots were supposed to be a physical representation of my components of drawing
              system. In actuality, unless they were drawing with a pencil, it was necessary for me to be around them
              while they drew to refill the pen with ink or to put paint on the paper to be smeared. They required
              tending to in that respect, though they were physically self-sufficient for a day at a time otherwise.
              It also solidified my observation that to try to eradicate the artist through the use of a system to create
              was just a constructive game. A tool to use instead of your brain. It also had a duration. A system will have
              the creative interaction at the start of the construction, whereas my systems also pursued this I would interact
              physically during the construction and create what I called errors, or what could be called randomness (or at least
              visual randomness). Rather than the DrawBots drawing on their own, I was playing with them. I was learning
              while they were not. I was proceeding from pencil, to ink, to paint. I was enjoying myself. The DrawBots
              were a tool or a toy, a system but not an independently constructive one. And that is an impossible game anyway.

							<h4>Complexity</h4>
							<p>My first step in exploring my reaction to the DrawBots and exploring the interaction
              between the artist and the system in the context of computation was to create further complexity.
            Switch statements have therefore been included to take the behaviour further from my prediction.
          And therefore give the impression of independence. This was also a useful technical tool to use if
        I develop alternative physical swarms of bots. Sine waves alter the speed on command from one DrawBot.
      I can see that randomness is key to the impression of life from my work. I naturally want to include
    random in the code (and will) so that the prediction gets harder for me to make as to the behaviour of the
  DrawBots. The tie to my fine art practice, where randomness/mistakes were where I decided creativity was
and which were exposed through the system is quite intriguing. I went around and around that, the system I made
ten years ago kept leading me back to myself. I could obscure myself to try to eradicate the artist, but I
emphasised only that it was impossible. The most I could reduce myself to was a decision in theory but the closest
I could get to erasing the artist was to theoretically obscure the artist in rules. Is this AI? If so it
definitely deserves the name artificial. </p>
