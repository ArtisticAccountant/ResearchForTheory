                        <p>In this section I consider my original intentions with DrawBots, a set of three drawing robots developed in 2018, to create a physical manifestation of my systems to distance myself from the process of creating. I then explore the next iteration of DrawBots I developed which expands upon these intentions by using random to create complexity. The section concludes with my recent conclusions with regards Systems art and the application of rules in my system.</p>

                        <p>The first iteration of the DrawBots developed as physical representations of the components of my fine art system that I developed based on my drawing practice. At one point, I saw them as individually separable components: one being the time element setting the pace for change; one being a pencil, one being paint etc. I saw a possible future iteration of the DrawBots as beginning to gesture or use physics in some way to articulate a movement. My intention was to finally distance my presence from the system and create a system that could make art without me.
                          </p>
                          <p>The reality was not as I had expected. Firstly, unless they were drawing with a pencil, it was necessary for me to constantly be around the DrawBots while they drew in order to refill the pen with ink or put paint on the paper to be smeared. They required tending to when they were actively making art, though I could leave them alone otherwise. Secondly, and more importantly, I did not want to leave them alone. I wanted to explore them, play with them, experiment with different attachments and materials. They were a tool or a toy.

                            After this experience, my next step was to explore my reaction to the DrawBots further by creating more complicated behaviour to try to distance them from me. I felt that behaviour that was harder to predict would mean that I would be less needed and less able to interfere. I also wanted to develop my technical skills further so I explore switch statements and counter functions to create behaviour which is harder for me to follow. I did find that I stood and watched them more often, and that placing paint where it was needed was harder to achieve. However, this experience finally gave a conclusion to the doubts of mine that had been growing for ten years; it was absolutely impossible to eradicate the artist. I was simply not willing to be eradicated, I was non-compliant with my own system. Even if I had been willing to be eradicated, it was not possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>The experiment had finally distanced my touch and physical presence from the making of art; however, having finally made physical objects, I saw and accepted that it simply was not possible to eliminate my presence. It is only possible to play with it, displace it, move it away from the making of a piece, introduce it in at certain points; in short, to treat my physicality and my intuition as materials in themselves. This is my new understanding of systems art in a computational context. A system is a creative structure which utilises the concept of elements, both in algorithms and conceptually, to mediate the human interaction with a computer, with or without additional sensors, and which also facilitates the manipulation and exploration of the role of the artist, be it physical or intuitive, in the making of work. Section 5 sets out a work in progress which is the articulation of this definition and in which I explore working in partnership with a computer to make art.
