                      <p>Part 5 presents my work in progress which brings my fine art practice and work with systems together with my experience from the preceding three exercises. This section presents four sketches on canvas which were created in response to three screen sketches. Three of the pieces start with one line or circle on a screen produced by a Processing sketch, and the final one presents a row of lines with different behaviours. In each of the pieces, I respond to the screen on the canvas. In this section, I will set out my experience so far and ideas for future work.</p>
                      <p>In terms of the technical setup, a small camera was attached to an easel and faces the canvas. This was to enable easy, mobile experimentation and also to explore the idea of a wooden, traditional and opposite parallel to a flat, metal and plastic screen and stand. The camera detects differences in the art on the canvas as I work on it, calculates the minimum, maximum, and average difference, and this information is then sent back to the Processing sketch. The size of the difference on the canvas impacts the vibration of the next line or circle drawn on the screen, or speed at which it moves etc.</p>

                                  <p>This is an extension of the importance of seriality in my practice. In this context, the action of the computer directs my action, as with DrawCommand or my fine art systems; however, there is feedback from me which creates a knock on effect similar to my line drawings in which wobbles of one line impact the wobbles of the following line. Seriality captures and makes visible life and actions.

                                    Each Processing sketch works on two fundamental modes which are related to my presence or absence. Related to this is my exploration of the use of random to create the aesthetics of life (wobbles and vibrations, for example). In this way, in each sketch, the computer is building a record of my presence and absence in a way which is similar to a canvas capturing my movement and touch in paint. The incorporation of random and vibrations into my screen sketches also explores how to bring my marks together with a computer&apos;s marks.

                                        Inky is a sketch in which one line on the screen begins the sketch and I make a corresponding line on the canvas which then impacts the degree of the vibrations of the next line on the screen. The screen sketch inspired by the characteristics of ink. It is another variation on the Board Works and Exercise 1 in that my system is visual, except the visual system is also reacting to the record of my action. The screen sketch has two fundamental modes - one where I have drawn on the canvas - causing a variation in vibrations, and one where I have not. If there has been no change to the canvas, then the lines will become straight. In this way, the computer is recording my presence and absence. It is also an inversion of the use of random to create the impression of life in a computer, in this case, I am recording the presence computer in the lack of variety of the straight lines, as much as my absence.

                                                        While making the piece, I found there were a lot of tasks to concentrate on which proved distracting. The setup required me to carry out a lot of tasks - picking up ink from the floor, following a line on a screen, perhaps timing the next drop of my ink, and also ensuring that my hand was not in front of the camera when the next photo was taken so that I did not interfere with the frame differencing.
                                                        So I could track when photos were being taken, I fed the camera image to a browser which I looked at on my phone. The knock on effect of this was that it meant that I was keeping track of time, a camera, ink, a screen, and the next line on the screen. The range of tasks was more complex than an artist would usually encounter in a studio and it changed what I was concentrating on. I was less able to focus on the art itself unless I slowed down a lot, and the setup also led to mistakes because I was distracted; the best one of which was getting carried away and imprinting my iPhone on the canvas in ink.

Similarly to Inky, one dot would appear at a time and the vibrations of the dots would increase when differences in the canvas were detected by the camera. Inky kept a constantly, slowly building record of the interaction between me and the computer; however, in Vibrating Dots, the dots would also rearrange themselves periodically. This meant that the record would be lost on the screen, whereas the canvas maintained the record. I did this to interfere with myself and see how I responded and what effect breaking the record and system had on the art.

I did two paintings in response to Vibrating dots and both capture the movement and, perhaps, the overall cluster of the circles rather than their exact location. In this respect, it is almost an Impressionist painting of a computer screen.
                                                              I could not reliably capture the location of the occasionally rearranging circles, so I ignored that aspect of the sketch and caught their impression instead. In this way, I was filtering the information down to a manageable amount.

This was inspired by my work around Imitation of Life and the use of bezier curves to create human-like scribbles with the addition of random. In <i>BezierBend</i> I saw the lines as being in conversation, one side was straight and lifeless like a computer, and the other side was bending, random and alive in response to my action on canvas. I created a few experiments using this format and I see it as both sides are almost in conversation - in some instances I introduced random into the computer side, in others I just left the lines as they were. This piece was a further exploration of the aesthetics of the computer hand versus my hand, or the aesthetics of the opposite, and how to create art when I make gestures and a computer makes lines, for example.

In fine art, I come up with an idea and do it. For this work, however, I come up with an idea and then have to doggedly pursue it; there is less directness between idea and outcome. The piece has required extensive technical experimentation to determine what lines can be detected by the camera, how big or dense the marks need to be, and how dark the canvas can be before marks stop being detected. The sketches here are still part of this process of technical experimentation. I cannot simply put a pen in my hand and do something when it feels right and clicks in my head. It could be argued that this is not dissimilar to being technically trained in how to draw or use oil paints and becoming proficient in that. To some extent that may be true, but for me personally this is a different way of working. Another observation about the process of using technology and computing in my art is that I have found that the technology itself gives me new ideas in a way that a paintbrush and canvas certainly do not give me.

Perhaps by extending the number of tasks I have to do and overloading myself, or creating patterns of events that have to be carried out before I can make a mark. It could even be as simple as watching for a light, or several lights, that trigger my action. In a way, that is a variation on Verostko&apos;s work where he uses a computer and random in search of automatic drawing, the subconscious and true creativity; by not being able to concentrate on what I am doing I might produce something I had not expected. Related to this is my continued awareness of the unintended results of the marks I am making; the paper that gets ink on it, the splashes that I had not planned, the iPhone imprint and so on. While I was making the four sketches set out here, I set out gridded paper on the floor to catch these unintended marks. The use of gridded paper is something I have been playing with for several years in my studio. It is related to the idea of random, or pretend predicting random, or the idea of random itself being pretend. It is pretend biology in Moura&apos;s work and an imitation or exploration of my hand in my work, for example.
