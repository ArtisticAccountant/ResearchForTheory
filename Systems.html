It is a good time to reflect from one Masters to another at a point in time when my practice has now shifted in some significant ways. It is essentially an autobiography of the last ten years tracing my thinking through some selected works shown or described here. The following tabs on this website set out 3 exercises XXX and one work in progress piece and the website is made to be read in order. Research method.

                                  Ten years ago I was working on my MA Fine Art and determined to work out how to eradicate the artist. It was a serious pursuit for me that I came to through studio practice and my inclination to break things and also piece things together like a puzzle. I had spent a Foundation year in art school drawing intricate patterns on part imagined forms, and as much as I had loved it at the time I was dissatisfied with it. It was too pretty and simple just to imagine and draw.

                                                I went into the Masters programme the next year and the first drawing I made was splashes of red ink on paper on top of another controlled line drawing I had made, another drawing was a shape being consumed by other shapes. It was not meant to be symbolic. It was irritation coming out, I only realised it several months later with hindsight that I was breaking my own practice. This continues today. I always have Kirk Vernedoe “productive reductions XXX” in my mind, I first read it ten years ago.

                                                    The first drawing I made as I began to break my practice was to put a pen in my mouth and move it along the paper from left to right repeatedly. I discovered that every time I took a breath, the pen moved off the paper. It started to make an image. I had made something that I hadn’t imaged. I had made my first discovery. And I was hooked, and I have never stopped. It is the only thing aside from people and learning that I have never become bored of eventually.

                                                    Over the next several months I experimented and made discoveries. I was exploring drawing. Breaking drawing down. I had imagined with lines on the Foundation programme, and in 2009 I was playing experimental games with them effectively. However, these were games I was very serious about. I still see my work in the studio as playing, but I am dead serious about it. Never traditionally inclined I never considered using a paintbrush, I would touch the paper with ink on my hand and see the twists of my hand as I moved from left to right repeatedly. Or draw lines repeatedly with a pen over 9 months. I was inclined towards drawing because it was honest - I cannot erase ink on paper, it captures everything, and it was also more inclined to experimentation. Paint always felt and feels heavy, whereas with ink my brain is lighter. I was adverse to colour. XXXX discuss some pieces here.

                                                                  One of my tutors at art school gave me feedback that said my work moved between machine-like precision and something else. And that always stuck in my mind. I drew these works with a needle-fine technical pen, steady pen, and quite frankly freakish levels of patience, they took months. At the same time I was wrapping myself in a tunnel of plastic and throwing balloons at boards. LEFT WITH QUESTIONS around precision and interaction. The machine and me.
                                                                  Presence of me - footprints, marks I left was coming out in my practice. I saw myself as a physical presence in my works. I tried to make it only about that. I couldn’t erase me. I began to realise I couldn’t win the game. But I kept playing it. I was hooked on it. Every mark is a sign you were there. Not someone else. No one else would make the same mark even if they did the same action precisely in movement. A room full of art student can draw the same model and they will all look totally and utterly different. I remember the first time I saw that in the Foundation year.

                                                            At the time I didn’t call the work Systems art. It was conceptual, process-based art made using rules. Or rules-based drawing. Or investigative. It was definitely Systems. I kept finding something amazing. The discovery. The accidents I was finding, the dots, the things I touch that because I touch them change. Like some kind of microscopic magic. I couldn’t admit it in 2009 because I was so hell-bent on eradicating the artist. But I had actually found the artist. It was the touch I made, the wobbles, the breaths, the infinite possibilities that Edmonds or XXXX artists talk about. Not just infinite possible decisions, but infinite possible results. And they are most infinite when you touch something. The constructive rules didn’t eradicate the artist, they found the artist. They showed me that the artist was at the start and end of a piece, if I had eradicated the artist in the middle to just being a physical presence carrying out the rules. If the artist wasn’t there, the rules would be dead. The art wouldn’t exist. The mistakes I made were infinite worlds to me. But I was still bent on eradicating the aritst.

It was conceptual, process-based art made using rules. Or rules-based drawing. Or investigative. It was definitely Systems. I kept finding something amazing. The discovery. The accidents I was finding, the dots, the things I touch that because I touch them change. Like some kind of microscopic magic. I couldn’t admit it in 2009 because I was so hell-bent on eradicating the artist. But I had actually found the artist. It was the touch I made, the wobbles, the breaths, the infinite possibilities that Edmonds or XXXX artists talk about. Not just infinite possible decisions, but infinite possible results. And they are most infinite when you touch something. The constructive rules didn’t eradicate the artist, they found the artist. They showed me that the artist was at the start and end of a piece, if I had eradicated the artist in the middle to just being a physical presence carrying out the rules. If the artist wasn’t there, the rules would be dead. The art wouldn’t exist. The mistakes I made were infinite worlds to me. But I was still bent on eradicating the aritst.
