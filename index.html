                      <p>This website presents reflective writing on my artistic practice to date. It traces the development of the use of rules and systems in my work over a ten year period and explores the evolution of my practice from my Master&apos;s in Fine Art in 2009 to my Master&apos;s in Computational Arts in 2019. In this section, I will review my past work from my present perspective by referring to examples of my work in a roughly chronological order and I will use images of pieces where possible. In subsequent sections I will present three exercises which set out the early process of transmuting my fine art practice into computation and a work in progress. This website presents a parallel autobiography of practice to the research I have undertaken into the practices of Ernest Edmonds, Roman Verostko and Leonel Moura for my essay <q>Systems Art in Computation: The Presence and Absence of the Artist</q>. It has also been inspired by the concept that the artist has <q>privileged access to her or his own creative processes</q> and as such can contribute to knowledge through their own practice-based experience and also through insight gained by the logging and subsequent analysis of practice process and development (Kjorup, pp. 25-26).

                                <p>Part 1 reflects my early work and explores the development of the use of rules in my practice. This section also contributed to the definition of Systems art given in <q>Systems Art in Computation</q>. Parts 2, 3, and 4 present a series of exercises intersecting between fine art and computation leading to my work in progress which is set out in Part 5. Part 2, <q>Imitation of Life</q>, presents my first interactive sketches with a programme and the exploration through drawing of the differences between my hand and the computer &apos;hand&apos;. Part 3, <i>Draw Command</i>, reflects on the translation of the elements of my drawing systems into a programme which subsequently tells me what to sketch. Part 4, <q>Physical System</q>, presents another iteration of my DrawBots which exhibit more sophisticated behaviour, and explores my reaction to the complexity. Part 5 details my work in progress which is the result of my research and each of the exercises.

                                <p>
                                  Ten years ago I was determined to eradicate the artist by constructing systems of rules and decisions to create distance from the process of making art. The ultimate goal was to eradicate intuition and reduce the number of decisions I made when making art down to zero. It took nearly a decade to articulate and accept what I reluctantly discovered instead; my rules led back to me. I have now come to the conclusion that the pursuit of the disappearing artist is old fashioned and unachievable, and fails to perceive the potential of systems processes in art. Systems are creative constructions that alter the location and role of the artist and enable new dimensions to creativity, this section will trace my early steps towards this conclusion.

                                                The immediate foundation to my initial pursuit of the eradication of the artist was in the year prior to my Master&apos;s, during my Foundation year in art school. In that year, I made intricate, semi-abstract drawings partly based on flowers and partly based on imagination. The forms in my drawings were covered in tiny lines and patterns derived from my inclination to see patterns and shapes with music and conceptual thought. They were highly imaginative and imagined; however, I was designing art and I became dissatisfied fairly rapidly with the lack of conceptual depth. The first drawings I made in my Master&apos;s year were frustrated and subconsciously destructive of this way of drawing - I drew splashes of red ink on thin lines; circles destroying forms in near battle; and I ripped and tore my drawings. This destruction continued throughout the Master&apos;s year as I broke drawing and my practice, and looked inside.

                                                    One of the first drawings I made as I began to break my practice was to place the paper on the floor where I usually drew, put a pen in my mouth, and move the pen along the paper from left to right repeatedly. This reversed my previous method of drawing which had depended on a high-level of physical control and concentration to draw a line. The control of my hand was replaced with my mouth, and my visual imagination was displaced by designing an action or scenario, not a result. I discovered that every time I took a breath, the pen moved off the paper and, as I repeated the movement, a drawing appeared. I had not imagined it, I had discovered it. Ten years later I can still remember my amazement. I was immediately hooked on this way of drawing which was logical, destructive and creative, and I have been irretrievably hooked ever since. It is from this experience that systems ultimately developed in my practice.

                                                      Over the next several months I experimented with breaking the lines, control and intuitive imagination of my practice. In so doing, I made more discoveries and I began to construct a definition of drawing. However, certain characteristics of my practice endured. In my Foundation year, my drawing had been elemental and consisted of black pen lines on white paper. Furthermore, I never planned and I never sketched in pencil. I imagined a drawing in my head, it &apos;clicked&apos;, and I then drew what I saw in my head on paper with very little hesitation. This way of drawing was a combination of decisive spontaneity and commitment. Similarly, as I broke my drawing practice during my Master's year, I came up with an idea, it clicked, and I carried out the idea. I also continued to explore black lines on white paper and how to make them by breaking the control of my hand. Lines were simple and reflected movement like a mirror. To make different lines and break the control of my hand, I experimented with tying my pen on string and swinging it different ways, for example. My attraction to the straightforward irreversibility of ink on paper also continued - paper captures everything, every splash, wobble, and even thoughts. Mistakes cannot be covered up or painted over with a layer of paint; drawing is light, it lacks the weight of paint and canvas. It also lacks the heaviness of art history categories and limiting analysis.

                                                        Around this time, I started undertaking research for my dissertation which, in turn, began to influence my practice. In particular, I encountered Paul Klee&apos;s Pedagogical Sketchbook and the statement <q>(a)n active line on a walk, moving freely, without a goal. A walk for a walk&apos;s sake</q>. I was intrigued by the logic, simplicity and playfulness of the idea that a line is a dot that moved. This deceptively simple concept has a whole world of possibilities around it that is still a fundamental aspect of my work today. Around this time I also encountered Wassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich, who collectively contributed to breaking the canvas apart in the early 20th century. I was drawn to the creative logic of the science of art Kandinsky developed with respect to the emotional impact of colour and shapes, as well as Mondrian&apos;s idea of a universal system and dynamic equilibrium that he captured in his paintings. The elemental reductionism of Malevich and the Constructivists, and the idea of the construction rather than creation of work, became particularly influential to the development of systems in my practice at the time.

                                                            The concept of artistic logic and elements of art as well as the idea of constructing work began to feed into my studio practice. I had been, quite instinctively, creating a definition of drawing from my experiments in the studio that broke drawing into elements and experimentally reconstructed them. However, with the research, the investigative destruction of my practice started to become consciously constructive as I began to contextualise my practice. One day, during this time, I spontaneously put ink on my finger and moved my hand from left to right across the paper. It resulted in the drawing above. Ten years later, I can still remember how beautiful I found it - it was like the mountains or ocean came out of my finger. From this point, I began to build a definition of drawing as consisting of elements of time, tool, material, and the physical position and movement of the artist, and I combined these in systems of rules. Time could be durations (nearly a year for one drawing), or intervals of time (three minutes); the movement could be a dotting action from left to right, or repeatedly moving my finger across paper; my physical presence was almost always fixed in one place standing on a stool, in the middle of the paper, or curled up on the floor; and, my hand might be used, or a pen. Each drawing experiment generated new ideas, more elements, and a deeper definition.

                                                            Through my studio work, I found that the beginning and end of my systems were really important points. I could not reduce my input at the start of the system beyond the elements and rules I chose, otherwise no art would exist. However, with comparative ease, I could strategise the end of the work away from aesthetic or intuitive choices by using time, or the dimensions of the paper to determine when the work was done. For example, in <i>3 Minutes to Nothing</i>, above left, I set timed intervals in which I had to dot a pen from the left edge to the right edge of a piece of paper. The intervals started at three minutes and reduced by ten seconds with each new row. This dealt with the beginning and end points of the process, however, I found that as I made the piece I invented new rules to adapt myself to the system I had made. For example, without deciding it beforehand, I was evenly spacing the marks across each row of the drawing. This meant that the work became about prediction. At the time I did not recognise it, however, adaptive, spontaneous decision-making whilst a piece is being made has become an aspect of the use of systems in my practice. It is not, necessarily, an intentional aspect of my systems work yet, but rather, because I am often taking an experimental approach, I find I have left out some defining rules to make a piece. The presence of spontaneous decision-making is also related to the fact that I was then, and remain still, a physical presence in the making of my work. The system structures my physical interaction with the paper or canvas which means that the possibility of interpretation, or even rebellion from the system, is open because every touch of the paper is a point of possibility.

                                                              As I neared the end of my Master&apos;s in Fine Art, my practice split into two broad directions -  conceptual systems and visual systems. The visual systems were produced on MDF board and I call them the <i>Board Works</i>. The <i>Board Works</i> took my conceptual systems and turned them into visual targets. I often used balloons filled with paint, or threw paint in some way at a system I had drawn onto a piece of board. The end point was decided before I began; for example, I might have to hit the centre of each circle before stopping, or cover the edge of a circle, or throw six times. These works expanded on the idea that I, as the artist, was a physical element of the system and, also, explored my precision. The works also began to visually articulate the opposites that, through my studio work, I had discovered arise when working with systems. My systems work moved conceptually and visually between the opposites of control and spontaneity, intention and mistakes, and freedom and restriction. Aesthetically, the rule of the clearly defined shape in the <i>Board Works</i> contrasted with the apparent spontaneity of the splash of paint. At the time, I seriously questioned whether I should draw the system with my hand or using tools. In the end, I usually compromised by spontaneously lifting items from my studio floor to draw around. With hindsight, I can see that by asking this question I was beginning to subconsciously recognise the idea that my systems came entirely from myself and I saw measuring tools as something external to myself and the system. In some ways, this is one of the questions that led me to computational art as the algorithms I make that determine the visual system that I interact with do not feel external in the way a ruler or compass would. Or, perhaps, it was the idea that the algorithm could make an alternative art-making entity which can be a parallel of myself.

                                                            I ended my Master&apos;s with a very visually diverse practice which moved between tightly controlled marks, and large, free-seeming gestures all generated from the idea of rules and elements. However, in the years after my Master&apos;s, I became troubled by the inherent contradiction in my practice that I could not ignore; my personality, instincts, and intuition were everywhere in my work, my presence was not merely physical. I chose my touch over a paintbrush; paper not canvas; ink rather than paint. I chose to logically and creatively destroy, not to create expressively or to design imaginatively. Even the white space with black ink showed the influence of the art I grew up with in Hong Kong and reflected my predilection towards simplicity, logic, and even record-keeping. My art was not the product of a detached practice or distanced artist, I had drawings that I loved more than anything I owned. Ten years later, I still check on them in the studio and worry about them. I had tried to erase the artist by eliminating intuition and allowing myself to be only a physical presence; however, it only served to highlight that there was something special about the artist&apos;s presence. Every time I touched the paper, I made mistakes. The out of place black mark on <i>3 Minutes to Nothing</i> was not designed, it was a mistake. I can remember my dismay rapidly turning into delight at this mistake. In addition, I found that I regularly interpreted the rules I made and improvised to fill in aspects of the system I had not considered beforehand. It was undeniable that, whenever I touched paper, I could see a world in the movement of the ink, the drops I did not mean to make, and the things that happened that I had not planned for. My systems seemed to make them happen, or highlight they existed. The system was supposed to reduce my intuition or creative presence as the artist and, effectively, turn me into a human machine, and it seemed to be highlighting my importance instead. My practice was fundamentally contradictory and highly productive and it took ten years and the exercises set out in the following sections to work through that contradiction.

                                                              I particularly focused on seriality in my work.
                                                              Seriality had been important to my practice during my Master&apos;s because it served to aesthetically structure works that I did not want to intuitively create. I divided seriality between repeated action and visual structure and continued to explore this in my practice after my degree. I produced a body of work in which I dropped paint at paint targets repeatedly, changing the colour of the paint after each cycle. I varied the rules for different pieces, in some works, for example, I dropped paint at the first drops, in others, at the most recent drop. In most pieces, I stopped when a certain mark had been covered up and I found that I created different patterns or formations of marks based on very simple variations to the rules. I also noticed that, as I made these works, I became confused sometimes; I would perhaps drop paint twice at the same target, or forget where the original target had been. On the one hand, I felt that I was
                                                              breaking my system, however, I recognised that the mistakes made the work more interesting. I produced other works exploring seriality and the variety that is exposed through seriality through lines and shapes which are set out here.

I could not distance myself from the work I made; I improvised, I made mistakes, and I made the system in the first place. The question at the foundation of systems work is fundamentally around creativity and the act of creation; and I became increasingly confused by the question of why I created what I created.
                                                                              It became immobilising rather than creative. In a way, I productively reduced art and this artist to confusion.
                                                                              Over the years, the knowledge that my practice was contradictory grew. I wanted to reduce or eliminate intuition, and yet, even at the most fundamental level, I would not make a piece unless I felt the internal click that it was right. That is not remotely detached; that is creativity, intuition, the mistakes, drops of ink I did not plan; the art. In fact, despite all my effort, the process is no different to when I was imagining drawings during my Foundation year. The works set out below are works from 2017 that, with hindsight, reflect the beginning of the transition of my understanding of systems; they are structured works but less so. The following sections explore exercises using computation which contributed to my new understanding of systems.
