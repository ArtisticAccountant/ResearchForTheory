                      <h4>Sketches with a projector</h4>
                      <p>In April 2018 I carried out my first experiment translating my practice into computing. I left my art course with an idea in my mind of competing with a machine. At one end of the spectrum, my drawing was almost mechanically precise, detailed and controlled. It also was not, the lines I drew caught my breath and my discomfort and thoughts in my mind. I wanted to test my hand against a machine. Imitation of Life is my first experimentation of interactive art-making with a computational machine. The sketches set out in this section are an extension of my Board Works. In the first set of sketches, a projected Processing image acts as a visual system or template which I then respond to. The second set of sketches explore the differences between my hand and a computer through drawing. These exercises generated many questions around the differences between me and a computer which centre on the fundamental incompatibility between my hand and a computer hand.</p>

<p>My immediate reaction to the working setup was to feel very uncomfortable. Working with a projected image meant that I was working with a flat, intangible image that did not quite exist. When I touched the image, I touched my studio wall and the image projected on the back of my hand. I could never actually touch it. This was the opposite of the things that I respond to as an artist. It was nothing like my Board Works covers in white paint I spent days sanding smooth and did not want anyone to touch but myself, which were covered in textures or pencil that smeared, and had a weight that I could barely lift. In addition, working with a projector meant that I was working with a kind of translated light, and it felt translated. The colours felt weak and the image was watery. Furthermore, the light contrasted entirely with the materials and situation I was working in. In order to work with light, I worked in the semi-darkness. This was not comfortable nor was it even particularly practical given I was working with paint. In this context, the paint I was working with felt heavy and thick, and the brightness of the colours dulled in contrast to the light. How the computer existed in this context was in total contrast to my existence.
</p>
<p>The speed and accuracy with which the computer operated far outstripped my own. The computer drew straight lines and perfect circles repeatedly and tirelessly. I became lost following it, and began to interpret the movement rather than use the images as a graphic template. Furthermore, while I could adapt and improvise an experimental response to the frustrating situation I had not expected, the computer could not. On top of this, it also occurred to me that while I was becoming frustrated with this situation, the computer was not. The computer did not even not care; it was simply not anything. For the purposes of this experiment, the computer and I existed in very different ways.

        <p>An area which particularly caught my attention in this experiment was the aesthetic difference between my hand and the computer hand. In Imitation of Life I put paint on my finger and smeared it or dolloped it whereas the computer drew perfect shapes and sharp edges. There is no gravity and no physics of the biological world in a computer; paint cannot drip unless I tell it to in an algorithm and a computer makes no mistakes. Visually, the two hands are not compatible in a piece of art without serious consideration of either bringing my hand and the computer hand closer together, or, balancing the differences. This brought me to research Verostko and his work to create brushstroke gestures with a mechanical hand, which are balanced with contrasting forms in his paintings.

                      </div>
                      <p>This exercise left me with several questions. Where can my hand meet the computer hand? Light is not automatically compatible with paper, paint and textures. Can I bring my hand into the computer by working on a screen? Can I print the computer hand on paper? I was also left questioning whether and how to bring my hand closer to the computer hand. This led to further drawing experiments on paper which are set out below.

                      <h4>Sketches with paper</h4>
                      <p>These drawing experiments explore the idea of printing the computer hand so that I do not have to interact with the computer in light. The exercises also test the visual effect of contrasting my hand with the computer, and at the other end of the scale, how to bring the two together. They explore how to both physically and graphically work with something that exists in such a different form to myself. The work also tests my response to working with printed, static sketches versus moving sketches given my level of discomfort working with the projected sketches.
                        </p>
                        <p>My first experiment was to draw against the straight lines. Lines capture life, and the computer printed sketch had no movement in contrast to my expected inaccuracies and wobbles. I felt the contrast between the two in this instance was complimentary rather than aesthetically conflicting. I found it to be more satisfying and calm to work with printed sketches rather than light projections. I could work at my own pace, in a comfortable drawing position and in the light rather than a light patch in a dark room.

                      </div>
<p>The next variation was to explore how to bring the hands closer together. For this, I experimented with the use of random and bezier curves to interfere with the straightness of the lines and make something that held the imitation of life in the randomness. Visually, it is difficult to tell my hand apart from the computer hand in the scribbles sketches. This raises the consideration that the multitude of lines in addition to random creates visual complexity which obscures the ability of the viewer to differentiate between the two hands. In addition, the scribble itself is more gestural, as opposed to a straight line which is almost a graphic shape, and so it was easier for me to imitate a tight, fast and free action.
  </p>
  <p>The sketches in Imitation of Life present my thoughts around how to work with a computer to make art. There are many complicated questions around the aesthetics of gesture when it is contrasted with the computer&apos;s distinct lack of gesture and my work on this is ongoing. Exercise 2 removes this question and, instead, translates my systems into the computer which then tells me what to do.
