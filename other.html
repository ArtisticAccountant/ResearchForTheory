                      <h4>Sketches with a projector</h4>
                      <p>In April 2018 I carried out my first experiment translating my practice into computing. In the first set of sketches, a projected Processing image acts as a visual system or template which I respond to. The second set of sketches are on paper and explore the differences between my hand and the computer &apos;hand&apos; through drawing. Together, the exercises generated several observations and questions which are set out in this section. The work represents my first experiments in interactive art-making with a computational machine and are an extension of my <i>Board Works</i>. The starting point for this body of work was an idea I had left my fine art course with several years before. I had left with an idea of competing with, and testing my hand against, a machine. This arose from the fact that my drawing can be mechanically precise, detailed and controlled in appearance; however, on closer inspection, the lines catch my breath, discomfort and the thoughts in my mind and are not mechanical at all. I wanted to explore the difference between the line I could draw and the line a machine could draw. </p>

<p>My immediate reaction to the working setup for <i>Imitation of Life</i> was to feel very uncomfortable. Working with a projected image meant that I was working with a flat, intangible image that did not quite exist. When I touched the image, I touched my studio wall and the image projected on the back of my hand. I could never actually touch it. This was the opposite of the things that I responded to as an artist. It was nothing like my <i>Board Works</i> covered in white paint I spent days sanding smooth, which were covered in textures or pencil that smudged, and had a weight that I could barely lift. In addition, working with a projector meant that I was working with a kind of translated light, and it felt translated. The colours felt weak and the image was watery. Furthermore, the light contrasted entirely with the materials and situation I was working in. In order to work with light, I worked in the semi-darkness. This was not comfortable nor was it even particularly practical given I was working with paint and could barely see it. In addition, the paint felt heavy, thick, and dull in comparison to the light. Computer light and screens make the colours in the world around them look dim and dark. How the computer existed in this context was in total contrast to my existence.
</p>
<p>I also found that the speed and accuracy with which the computer operated far outstripped my own. The computer drew straight lines and perfect circles repeatedly and tirelessly. I became lost following it, and began to interpret the movement rather than use the images as a graphic template. Furthermore, while I could adapt and improvise an experimental response to the frustrating situation I had not expected, the computer could not. On top of this, it also occurred to me that while I was becoming frustrated with this situation, the computer was not. The computer did not even not care; it was simply not anything. I had hoped that the medium of an image would act as a common ground between the computer and myself, instead this exercise highlighted many important differences and complexities that I needed to consider.

        <p>An area which particularly caught my attention in this experiment was the aesthetic difference between my hand and the computer hand. In <i>Imitation of Life</i> I put paint on my finger and smeared it or dolloped it; I had gestures and soft fingers, the computer had no touch and drew perfect shapes and sharp edges.
          From this experience I realised that the two hands would not be compatible in a piece of art without serious consideration of methods to either bring my hand and the computer hand closer together, or balance the differences.
          In the world of the computer there is no gravity, no touch, and no physics of the biological world; paint cannot drip unless I tell it to in an algorithm. A computer makes no mistakes, unless I have made one.
          If art is systematic creativity, mistakes, touch, spontaneity, ideas; then the computer absolutely cannot make art.

                      <p>This exercise left me with several useful questions: Where could my hand meet the computer hand if not in projected light? Could I bring my hand into the computer by working on a screen? Could I print the computer hand on paper? These questions led to the drawing experiments set out below and influenced
                        the other exercises reviewed on this website as well as my work in progress.

                      <h4>Sketches with paper</h4>
                      <p>The drawing experiments set out below explore the idea of printing the computer hand and were undertaken in December 2018. The drawings were devised to explore how to both physically and graphically work with something that exists in such a different form to myself. The exercises tested both the visual effect of contrasting my hand with the computer, and bringing the two closer together. In addition, the work was also set up to test my own response to working with printed, static sketches instead of moving sketches given my level of discomfort working with the projected sketches.
                        </p>
                        <p>My first experiment was to draw against the straight lines. Lines capture life, and the computer printed sketch had no movement in contrast to my expected inaccuracies and wobbles. I felt the contrast between the two in this instance was complimentary rather than aesthetically conflicting, perhaps because I was working with pen which matched and balanced the printed computer line rather than directly touching the paper with my finger. In addition, I found that working with printed sketches meant that I could work at my own pace, in a comfortable drawing position, and in the light rather than in a light patch in a dark room.

<p>The next variation was to explore how to bring the hands closer together. For this, I experimented with the use of random and bezier curves to interfere with the straightness of the computer lines and make something that held the imitation of life in the randomness; as though the computer itself was breathing or moving like I might.
In addition, the scribble is gestural, as opposed to a straight line which is almost a graphic shape, and so it was easier for me to imitate a tight, fast and free action.
  Visually, it is difficult to tell my hand apart from the computer hand in the scribbles sketches. This experiment raised the idea in my mind that the multitude of lines, in addition to random, created visual complexity which obscured the ability of the viewer to differentiate between the two hands.
  In that way, the impression of life is given in the imitation.
  </p>
  <p>The sketches in <i>Imitation of Life</i> present my initial thoughts around how to work with a computer to make art. There are many complicated questions around the aesthetics of gesture when it is contrasted with the computer&apos;s distinct lack of gesture.
    The application of random to create the feeling of breath or movement brings the graphic forms a computer makes closer to a gesture I might make; however, I am drawn to the idea of exploring the differences.
The work undertaken in <i>Imitation of Life</i> is linked to the idea of visual systems and the physical, mechanical artist; however, it also represents a move to explore the artist as something other than a physical entity in a system. It begins to explore the artist working together with a computer
through the system.
    In contrast to Exercise 1, Exercise 2 explores the conceptual rather than visual systems of my practice in the context of computation by translating my systems into the computer, which then tells me what to do.
